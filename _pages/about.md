I was awarded the prestigious Erasmus Mundus Postdoctoral Fellowship from the European Commission, ERCIM Alain Bensoussan Fellowship from the European Union, and SERB OPD Fellowship from Dept. of Science and Technology, Government of India. I have received the 2020 IEEE Systems Journal Best Paper Award. I am an IEEE Senior Member. I have received four research grants for conducting research-based projects, three of them as Principal Investigator (PI). I also received many travel grants to attend conferences and doctoral colloquiums. I have more than 12 years of teaching and research experience, few of them are from highly reputed organizations around the world. I also worked as a software professional at IBM for one and a half years. I am the author of more than 45 scholarly research papers, which have been published in reputed journals and conferences, and IT magazines. I have also published two edited books.
